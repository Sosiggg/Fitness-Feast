# Fitness Feast

## Description
**Fitness Feast** is a recipe website designed for fitness-focused individuals. The platform offers a wide variety of recipes, each complete with nutritional facts, calorie counts, and categorized to meet specific fitness goals. This project, inspired by the renowned website [Pinch of Yum](https://pinchofyum.com/), was developed using **React.js**, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 

The project includes the following key features:
- Recipe display with detailed nutritional facts
- Categorization of recipes based on fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, etc.)
- User-friendly interface with a focus on a clean and modern design
- The website is currently optimized for **desktop** devices, and mobile responsiveness is under development.

While the project is still in its early stages and is a work in progress, it has been designed to improve upon the layout and UI of the original source of inspiration.
