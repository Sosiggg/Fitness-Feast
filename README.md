# Fitness Feast

## Description
**Fitness Feast** is a recipe website designed for fitness-focused individuals. The platform offers a wide variety of recipes, each complete with nutritional facts, calorie counts, and categorized to meet specific fitness goals. This project, inspired by the renowned website [Pinch of Yum](https://pinchofyum.com/), was developed using React.js. While the user interface improves upon the original design, with enhancements to layout and responsiveness, the project is currently optimized for desktop devices.
